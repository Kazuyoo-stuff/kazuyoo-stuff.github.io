## Celestial-Render-FlowX [v1.8]
- Improved EGL & HWUI initialization for faster GL context loading and reduced first-frame stutter.
- Optimized RenderEngine behavior and disabled unnecessary telemetry/tracing overhead.
- Enabled SurfaceFlinger multithreaded present and frame-rate priority for better frame delivery stability.
- Disabled VSYNC processing when screen is off to reduce background wakeups.
- Disabled GPU input boost for more consistent frequency scaling under load.
- Enabled Adreno GPU overclock support (OC/OV enabled, UC/UV disabled) for higher peak performance.
- Forced Mali GPU always-on mode to reduce wake latency during gaming sessions.
- Kept SDE Rotator clock active to minimize display pipeline latency.
- Disabled simple GPU scaling algorithm to prevent aggressive downscaling and micro-stutter.
- Disabled MediaTek Dynamic Clock Scaling (DCS) mode for more stable GPU frequency behavior.
- Enabled touch boost to improve input responsiveness and reduce touch latency.
- Enabled ADPF CPU Hint (Android 13+) for smarter CPU performance coordination during gaming.
- Integrated automatic Game Driver / ANGLE driver selection based on Android version.
- Added dynamic renderer switching (Vulkan / OpenGL) with automatic driver configuration.
- Implemented automatic compatibility handling for Android 12+ updatable driver system.
- Cleaned up conflicting driver settings before applying new renderer configuration.
